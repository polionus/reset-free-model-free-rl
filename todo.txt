1. Make an environment where the goal moves and the agent has to continually track it. 
    1. Give the agent the whole map
    2. Give it its position
2. Experiment: A. Reset the agent B. Do not reset the agent. (Agents that get into infinite loops)
3. Make visualizations work
4. Research Question: Maybe showing that some seeds fail catasrophically, means that we need better methods for dealing with this in the reset free case. 
    Maybe the agent needs an internal mechanism that signals a need for change. 
5. If intrinsic motivation + small net: FAIL , But intrinsic motivation + Big Net Succ, then interesting, maybe paper. (We can test regularization or very simple plasticitty mitigations such as drop out or weight resets.)
    (Reasoning: If interesting, this means that the problem with resets means that intrinsic motivation was not effective becasue of plasticitty) (plasticitty <---> intrinsic motivation) [They need to exist together]
